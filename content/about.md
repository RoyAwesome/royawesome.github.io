Hi there.  I'm Garrett.  I've been in gamedev for over 15 years, and programming for longer.

I use this page to document things I find in Unreal Engine, C#, Arc Inventory musings, and more.

## History

I got into gamedev working on a few Source Engine mods, such as [Source Forts](https://www.moddb.com/mods/sourceforts) and [Empires](https://www.empiresmod.com/)

From there, I worked on various Minecraft mods, contributing to Craftbukkit and becoming a developer on [Spoutcraft](https://github.com/Spoutcraft/Spoutcraft) and it's cancelled successor [Spout](https://github.com/droplet).

I helped build and ship [Squad](https://joinsquad.com/) until 2017, as the lead programmer.  I'm especially proud of the construction and vehicle system I designed and implemented.  

After that, I became the Technical Director at [Puny Human](https://punyhuman.com/), contributing to [dozens of games](https://punyhuman.com/projects/)

I create and maintain the Unreal Engine plugins [Arc Inventory](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/arc-inventory) and [Arc Teams](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/arc-teams) 

For my side projects, I'm sometimes porting Empires to Unreal Engine 5, Sometimes working on a game engine in C++, and sometimes working on a 3d tile game in C#.
